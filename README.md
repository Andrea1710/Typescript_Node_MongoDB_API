# TYPESCRIPT_NODE.JS_MONGODB API

Simple REST API with CRUD operations using Typescript, Node.js for the Server and MongoDB as Database.
Wiht this API, we can create Users and Posts related between each other (one or more Posts can be related to a specific User).

## Installation

After cloning the Repository, run the command:

```bash
npm install
```

and then run the command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

to start the Server.

## Usage

After starting the Server, visit the page http://localhost:3000/api/users to get the list of Users and http://localhost:3000/api/posts to get the list of Posts.

If still empty, use POSTMAN or any other tool for POST requests on the same routes to create one.
